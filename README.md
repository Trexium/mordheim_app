# mordheim_app
A helper app for the tabletop game Mordheim.

Here ye! Here ye!
Looking for Beta tester for Android app!

I've been working on an android app as a tool to minify the amount of pdf-scrolling i gameplay.

What you can do wtih the app?
Check warband-hired sword compatability.
Check tables/roll for Animosity, Random happenings, Stupidity, Blackpowder misfires, Critical hits, etc.
Post game stuff like Serious injuries, Rewards of the Shadowlord, Sawbones, etc.

Since my last post was deleted, i will leave the signup link off the post.

If you have any interest to help me test the app send me a PM och email at mordheim@hexedscenery.com
